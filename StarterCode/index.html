          <h3>Correlation between Poverty and Lack of Healthcare</h3>
          <p>A weak, positive correlation (R squared = 0.28) is observed between the percentage of people living in poverty and the percentage of people lacking healthcare by US state. States such as Mississippi and New Mexico have the highest poverty rates in the country, and while they don't have the highest levels of lacking healthcare, they are in the top 20% of lacking healthcare. On the other end of the spectrum, states such as Massachussets and Vermont stand out for having the lowest levels of lacking healthcare in the country. While these two states don't have the lowest poverty rates, they're in the bottom 20% of poverty levels. Generally, lower poverty levels are correlated with lower lack of healthcare levels.</p>
          <p>The low correlation suggests that other factors are needed to predict the percentage of people who are lacking healthcare, beyond just the poverty rate. State budgets, social assistance programs and state healtcare spending could all be factors that might be involved.</p>
